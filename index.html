                  My name is Daniel Johansson. I am a 34 year old male born and raised in the costal town
                  Falkenberg on the west cost of Sweden. I still live here and love small town feel and
                  the proximity to the sea. For the last ten years I have been working at the customer
                  servie of Hallandstrafiken, which I have been very pleased with, but currently I am studiyng
                  at Campus Varberg to become a software developer.

              <h2>My interests</h2>
              <p>
                  Since starting my studies to become a Software Developer I have a newfound interest
                  in coding. In fact, before I started my education/training I wasn't actually sure I
                  would enjoy sitting infront of a computer writing lines of code.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Except from my aspiration of becoming a software developer I have set a goal that I 
                  will learn how to sail and acquire a kustskepparintyg (Costal yachtmaster Diploma).
                  Up until today I have taken a one week course in sailing so I have a long way to go.
                  <br>
                  <br> 
                  I also have a hobby of collecting seeds from various fruits and plants,
                  making them sprout and trying to grow them in my small department.
